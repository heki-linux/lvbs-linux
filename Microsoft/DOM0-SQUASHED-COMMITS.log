    hyperv: Adding multiprocessing to linux host
    
    Added the 4 necessary hypercalls to allow a Linux host to boot
    application processors on Hyper-V. Previously smpboot would fail to
    bring up any processors other than the root during the boot sequence.
    
    Added hypercalls:
    HVCALL_GET_PARTITION_ID: The partition ID is necessary to make several
    hypercalls including HVCALL_DEPOSIT_MEMORY. The hypercall is made
    at the end of hv_init since it must be made after hypercalls are
    enabled, but before smp.
    
    HVCALL_DEPOSIT_MEMORY: The host must deposit memory into the hypervisor
    before making other more complex hypercalls, such as the following.
    
    HVCALL_ADD_LOGICAL_PROCESSOR and HVCALL_CREATE_VP: The host must notify
    the hypervisor of any logical APs so that the hypervisor can create a
    VP. These hypercalls are made during hv_smp_prepare_cpus so that the
    VPs can be achitecturally started by the host during smp.

    hyperv: Moving hv nested bit to hypercall caller
    
    Changed responsibility of nested bit from 4 hypercall functions
    (hv_do_hypercall, hv_do_rep_hypercall, hv_do_fast_hypercall8,
    hv_do_fast_hypercall16) to each function's caller. This allows
    hypercalls to be routed to the nested hypervisor and since each caller
    is more informed about the intended target, the caller should be
    applying the bit, not the generic hypercall function.
    
    Changed the latter 3 hypercall signatures to accept the full u64 control
    rather than the u16 call code for consistency with hv_do_hypercall and
    to accommodate the nested bit (the 31st bit).

    Hack to run nested
    
    This is a forward port version of John Stark's patch.
    
    It seems that when running as Dom0, we should skip setting up some
    pages. Need to confirmv this later.
